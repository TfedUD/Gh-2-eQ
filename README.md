# Gh-2-eQ
Initial eQuest model generation in Rhino/Grasshopper project to be developed with further interoperability.
The overall intent is to create interoperability and parallel workflow between LBT's E+ workflow, maybe some day some further interop with LBT interoperable Passive House tooling.



Currently: initialTBwip.py:   runpythonscript in Rhino: assigns names to spaces
surfaces.py retrieves space data and passes to bldgFlr.py which instantiates all of tthe nessisary properties needed for named polys: floors and spaces for *.inp






Big shout to PF for enabling these shenanigans, and to EM as always; for continually sharing wisdom and knowledge.

This project is heavily based on: and borrowed from the work of:
https://www.ladybug.tools/
http://passivehousetools.com/

Of which for some of us was why we wanted to learn how to code, and your work has been an ongoing reference and #goals.
Thank you for open source and inspiring many.
Opensource: 'This is the way'.
