# Gh-2-eQ
Initial eQuest model generation in Rhino/Grasshopper project to be developed with further interoperability.
The overall intent is to create interoperability and parallel workflow between LBT's E+ workflow, maybe some day some further interop with LBT interoperable Passive House tooling.

Big shout to Prudence Ferreira for enabling these shenanigans, and to Ed May as always; for continually sharing wisdom and knowledge.
