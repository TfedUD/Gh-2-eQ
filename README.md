# Gh-2-eQ
Initial eQuest model generation in Rhino/Grasshopper project to be developed with further interoperability.
The overall intent is to create interoperability and parallel workflow between LBT's E+ workflow, maybe some day some further interop with LBT interoperable Passive House tooling.

Big shout to PF for enabling these shenanigans, and to EM as always; for continually sharing wisdom and knowledge..

This project is heavily based on: and borrowed from, and inspired by the work of:<br>
https://www.ladybug.tools/<br>
http://passivehousetools.com/<br>

BUT IS NOT AS GOOD AS yet.

Of which for some of us was why we wanted to learn how to code, and your work has been an ongoing reference and #goals.
Thank you for open source and inspiring many.
Opensource: 'This is the way'.
