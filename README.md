# Gh-2-eQ
Initial eQuest model generation in Rhino/Grasshopper project to be developed with further interoperability.
The overall intent is to create interoperability and parallel workflow between LBT's E+ workflow, maybe some day some further interop with LBT interoperable Passive House tooling.

Big shout to Prudence Ferreira for enabling these shenanigans, and to Ed May as always; for continually sharing wisdom and knowledge.

This project is heavily based on: and borrowed from the work of:
https://www.ladybug.tools/
http://passivehousetools.com/

Of which for some of us was why we wanted to learn how to code, and your work has been an ongoing reference and #goals. Thank you for open source. 'This is the way'.
